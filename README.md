   - **Purpose**: This allows for tracking of order items within specific product categories. 

4.  **Products and Subcategories**:
   - **Relationship**: Many-to-one (many products belong to one subcategory).
   - **Purpose**: This relationship allows for the classification of products into specific subcategories.
     
5. **Categories and Subcategories**:
   - **Relationship**: One-to-many (one category can have multiple subcategories).
